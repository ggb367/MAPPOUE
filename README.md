# MAPPOUE - Mechanically Adaptable Path Planning for Unavoidable Obstacle Environments
The limitations of rigid form robots decrease the number of possible applications and situations for these robots as well as their capacity to seamlessly blend into everyday scenarios. We predict a solution to how we can increase the complexity of a robotâ€™s operation environment while improving its compatibility with society is to remove the rigidity of traditional robots. Instead, we will allow a set of flexibility parameters, orientation (relative to the obstacle), angle of approach, and limb configuration to determine the result of our path planning algorithm.
